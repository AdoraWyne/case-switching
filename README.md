# Next TODO:

- Change it to form so it can handle when user click `Enter` and form validation
  - Uncontrolled form is better - there is no need for React after you are done transformed the input. React only cares about the output.
- Write RTL for `src/App.tsx`?
  - Yes, for learning

# Case Switching

Turn string from one format to another format

## Kebab to Title

### Improvement - Future TODO

**Validation**

1. When user enters a non kebab sentence, prompt a warning message
2. When user enters more than 100 maxlength, prompt an error message.
